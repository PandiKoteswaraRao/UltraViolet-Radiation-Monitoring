# UltraViolet-Radiation-Monitoring
Using PIC16F877A and Guva-S12SD Sensor

The aim of our project is to monitor  the UltraViolet radiation using Guva S12SD Sensor and PIC16F877a which displays the values of Voltage , Sensor value and UV Index  LCD . These values must switch accordingly on pressing a key.
